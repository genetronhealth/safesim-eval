This directory contains bed files and variant-related files of multiple formats for simulation.

This README shows how to generate the files in the simfiles directory.

1. Prepare ctDNA variant files

The original gold standard VCF file is downloaded from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Consensus_Target_Region/13511829 (KnownPositives_hg19.vcf.gz).
The original bed files of companies IDT and ILM are downloaded from https://figshare.com/projects/SEQC2_Onco-panel_Sequencing_Working_Group_-_Liquid_Biopsy_Study/94523

The variants to be simulated are known positive variants from KnownPositives_hg19.vcf.gz which are in the bed region of each company.
The gold standard VCF contains variant information of tumor cfDNA Sample A which matches the normal Sample B,
the allele fraction (AF) to be simulated in Sample B is 20% of the AF in the gold standard Sample A, 
because 20% of the AF in Sample A is identical to the AF in the physical-mixture Sample D. (more information about Samples A/B/D is described in the paper at https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02316-z)

Then, different formats of variant files are generated using bedtools/bcftools to meet the requirements of different variant simulators.

And the regions in bed files are narrawed down to select only variant positions to speed up the process of evaluation.

The customized gold standard txt file contains 5 columns (seperated by '\t') representing mutation, AF, gene, CNT from COSMIC database and allele-fraction level, respectively.
CNT and gene annotation are derived from COSMIC(v94) database.


2.Prepare WES variant files

The original gold standard VCF file is downloaded from https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/seqc/Somatic_Mutation_WG/release/latest/

To make the results meaningful, each variant is simulated only if its allele depth >= 1 and its AF <= 0.9.
Then, different formats of variant files are generated using bedtools/bcftools to meet the requirements of different variant simulators.

And the regions in bed file are narrawed down to select only variant position to speed up the process of evaluation.

The customized gold standard txt file contains 5 columns (seperated by '\t') representing mutation, AF, gene, CNT from COSMIC database and allele-fraction level, respectively.
CNT and gene annotation are derived from COSMIC(v94) database.
